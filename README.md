Part 1: Theoretical Study of COPASI
A comprehensive analysis of COPASI (Complex Pathway Simulator), a specialized software for modeling and simulating biochemical networks. This section covers:
General presentation and core functionalities.
Technical aspects, including deterministic (ODE) and stochastic solvers.
Evaluation of strengths (high performance, SBML compliance) and limitations.
Part 2: Practical Exploration of Zenodo
A detailed study of the Zenodo platform and its role in Open Science and research in Natural and Life Sciences (NLS).This section documents:
Topic: Neurogenesis and neuronal regeneration in status epilepticus.
Methodology: Steps for searching, selecting, and downloading research data.
Metadata Analysis: Extraction of technical data structured according to the Dublin Core standard, including DOI, creator information, and rights management.
